### Course Learning Goals
- Use Python and other data science tools to prepare data for research
- Learn to conduct spatial analysis and modeling using Python and other data science tools

As part of my undergrad coursework, I learned how to make maps with “off-the-shelf” programs, such as ESRI’s ArcGIS platform and ENVI. Although these programs are considered the “industry standard,” they are inaccessible to community organizations with limited financial and technical capacity. I am deepening my involvement in research done by the community for the community, so I want to learn how to use more accessible data-science tools to produce tables, charts, and maps.
